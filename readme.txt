**Is Contact Form 7 spam destroying your mornings?**

Every day, the same nightmare: dozens of fake submissions, worried you'll miss real customers, and other plugins want $60/year just for basic protection.

This free plugin ends that nightmare today.

= How It Works =

**3 Steps to Spam-Free Contact Forms:**

1. **Install** - Search "Contact Form 7 spam" in your WordPress dashboard
2. **Activate** - One click to turn on protection
3. **Relax** - Your Contact Form 7 and WPForms and others are now protected from bots

The moment you activate, spam bots are automatically blocked on all your forms and comments. No settings to configure. No technical knowledge required. No ongoing maintenance.

**Most users report 95-100% spam reduction within the first 24 hours.**

Tomorrow morning, check your inbox. Instead of dozens of spam submissions, you'll see only real customer inquiries. That's the peace of mind this plugin delivers.

= Why Contact Form 7 Needs This =

Contact Form 7 is WordPress's most popular form plugin with over 5 million active installations. It's lightweight, flexible, and completely free.

But it doesn't include spam protection.

Without protection, Contact Form 7 sites get hammered. Bot networks discover unprotected forms and flood them with submissions. Your inbox fills with junk. You waste time sorting real inquiries from spam. Worse, you risk missing legitimate customers buried in the noise.

This plugin fixes that problem. For free. Forever.

= Free vs Pro: What You Get =

**FREE Version (Most Sites Need Only This):**
✅ Contact Form 7 bot spam blocked
✅ WPForms automated spam stopped
✅ Jetpack forms protected
✅ Fluent Forms secured
✅ SureForms protected
✅ WordPress comment spam eliminated
✅ Works on business/commercial sites
✅ Spam statistics dashboard

Automated bots cause 95%+ of spam. The free version handles this completely.

**PRO Version (For Advanced Needs):**
⚡ AI-powered human spam detection
⚡ Gravity Forms integration
⚡ WooCommerce registration protection
⚡ Email quarantine for review
⚡ Custom IP blocklists
⚡ Allow/deny pattern rules
⚡ Priority support

Most Contact Form 7 users never need Pro. But if you're getting manually-typed spam or need enterprise features, Pro has you covered.

= Why This Works Better Than CAPTCHA =

CAPTCHA makes your visitors prove they're human by solving puzzles. It's annoying, hurts conversions, and still lets some spam through.

This plugin takes a smarter approach:

- **Invisible honeypot fields** - Bots can't resist filling hidden fields that humans never see
- **Timing analysis** - Bots submit forms instantly; real people don't
- **Behavioral fingerprinting** - Bot patterns are detectable and consistent
- **No user friction** - Your visitors never know the protection exists
- **Lightning fast** - All processing happens locally on your server

Your Contact Form 7 stays fast. Your conversion rates stay high. Spam disappears.

It just works. Quietly. Effectively. Completely free.

= Common Questions Answered =

**"Will this work with my existing Contact Form 7 setup?"**
Yes. It integrates automatically with all CF7 configurations, custom fields, and extensions. Nothing breaks. Spam just stops.

**"I'm not technical. Can I install this?"**
If you can install a WordPress plugin, you can use this. There's literally nothing to configure. Install, activate, done.

**"What about sites that aren't in English?"**
Works perfectly on all languages. The spam detection doesn't depend on language - it detects bot behavior patterns.

**"My site sells products. Do I have to pay?"**
No. Unlike some popular anti-spam solutions that charge business sites, this is free for commercial use. No exceptions. No hidden fees.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this too good to be true? What's the catch? =

No catch. We make money from optional Pro upgrades for advanced features like AI-powered human spam detection and Gravity Forms support. But the free version isn't a trial - it's genuinely free forever and solves most spam problems completely.

We believe every WordPress site deserves spam protection, regardless of budget. That's why the free version is actually free - no restrictions, no time limits, no "gotchas."

= Will this really stop my Contact Form 7 spam problem? =

Yes. The vast majority of Contact Form 7 spam comes from automated bots, and this plugin blocks them completely. You'll see results immediately - typically zero spam within the first day.

If you're one of the rare cases getting manually-typed spam (someone actually sitting there typing spam messages), the Pro version includes AI detection for that. But most sites never need it.

= I use WPForms. Does this work for me too? =

Absolutely. Works perfectly with WPForms Lite and WPForms Pro. Same instant protection, same zero configuration. WPForms users see the same dramatic spam reduction as Contact Form 7 users.

= I'm not technical. Will I mess something up? =

Impossible. The plugin requires zero configuration. Install it, activate it, walk away. Your forms keep working exactly as they do now, except spam stops arriving. There's nothing to break.

If you can click "Activate" on a plugin, you can use this successfully.

= What about my existing Contact Form 7 extensions and custom fields? =

Everything works together seamlessly. The plugin integrates invisibly with all CF7 configurations, custom fields, conditional logic, and third-party extensions. Your forms don't change. Spam just stops.

= Do I need to sign up for anything or get an API key? =

No. No signup. No API key. No external accounts. No tracking. Install the plugin and it works immediately using only your WordPress installation.

The free version processes everything locally on your server. Fast, private, and completely independent.

= My business site has products/ads. Will I get charged? =

Never. This plugin is free for commercial use with zero restrictions. Many popular anti-spam solutions charge business sites - this one doesn't and never will.

Run a business? Have affiliate links? Sell products? Still free. Always free.

= Will adding this plugin slow down my site? =

No. The plugin processes spam detection locally without calling external APIs. There's no network delay, no waiting for remote servers. Your Contact Form 7 performs exactly as it does now, just without the spam.

= I have Gravity Forms. Can I use this? =

Gravity Forms protection is included in the Pro version. If you invested in premium forms, the small Pro upgrade gives you complete spam protection with email logging and advanced features designed for Gravity Forms users.

= Which forms work with the free version? =

Contact Form 7, WPForms Lite, WPForms Pro, Jetpack Contact Forms, Fluent Forms, and WordPress comments all get full bot protection in the free version.

That covers the vast majority of WordPress forms in use today.
